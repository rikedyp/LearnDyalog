# Introductory Tutorials

## New to programming
The book [Mastering Dyalog APL](https://mastering.dyalog.com) by Bernard Legrand is aimed at new developers and is suitable for people with no prior programming experience. However, it is also a fairly comprehensive guide to the many aspects of both the APL language and the Dyalog development environments, and so intermediate and advanced users will still find it valuable.

The book was originally published in 2009, and although it is being re-worked as an e-book to include chapters on recent features, the original is still [available as a physical book](https://www.dyalog.com/mastering-dyalog-apl.htm).

## New to APL
If you are already familiar with a programming language or two, the book [**Learning APL**](https://xpqz.github.io/learnapl) by Stefan Kruger offers an excellent introduction to modern APL for experienced programmers.

## Guided problem sets
Our [APL Course](https://course.dyalog.com) is a set of guided problem sets with examples and explained solutions.

It aims to cover the majority of language constructs and is broader in scope than [**Learning APL**](#new-to-apl), but not as comprehensive as [Mastering Dyalog APL](#new-to-programming).
