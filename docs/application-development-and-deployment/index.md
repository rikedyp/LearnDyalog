# Application Development and Deployment
Once you have written some code to solve your problem, you might want to make it available for others to use. Your users may be other specialists in your field, or other people looking to do similar processing or analysis as you. They may or may not also be APL users.

The basic method of debugging is to trace through a function using **Action â†’ Trace** or typing <kbd>Ctrl+Enter</kbd> with the text cursor on the expression you want to trace through. You can then step through multi-line functions one expression at a time.

Learn how to interpret error messages, trace the execution of an application step-by-step, and set break points to help debugging in the [First-Aid Kit chapter of Mastering Dyalog APL](https://mastering.dyalog.com/First-Aid-Kit.html).
