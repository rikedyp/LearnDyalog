# Suggested Learning Route
With so many resources available, it can be hard to know where to start.

!!!Note "Recommendation only"
	This is just a recommendation. After learning the basics of Dyalog, we hope this site will help you navigate resources relevant to your particular area of interest.

1. Whet your appetite
	
	These videos give a flavour of what it looks like to use APL:

	- [The Heart of the Algorithm](https://dyalog.tv/APLSeeds23/?v=O73HYH0p8eo)
	- [Easy to Learn, Worth Mastering](https://dyalog.tv/APLSeeds22/?v=o-0xk96_BNw)
	- [Will You Play APL With Me?](https://dyalog.tv/APLSeeds21/?v=U6ofXSYTST8)

1. Start playing with the TryAPL tutorials
	You don't have to install anything to get started.
	
	Enter glyphs by clicking the language bar at the top of the page, or using the prefix entry method. For example, on a U.S. keyboard, backtick (``` ` ```), in the top-left of the keyboard) followed by `=` gives `รท`.

	:material-star-four-points-outline: Go to the [Try APL tutorials](https://tryapl.org/?tab=learn)

1. Follow one of our recommended [introductory texts](./introductions.md)

1. At some point, you will feel restricted by the limitations of TryAPL. We recommend [installing Dyalog](./index.md#installing-dyalog) for the best experience.

1. Learn the basics of the Dyalog interface

	- rosetta code
	- dfns workspace
	- advent of code

1. Try solving some problems yourself. Some of these have public examples of solutions that you can study
