### External Publications

Members of [Team Dyalog](https://www.dyalog.com/meet-team-dyalog.htm) regularly present papers at technical conferences and publish articles in technical publications – a number of links to these articles are collected below.

A large collection of excellent papers by some of the giants on whose shoulders we stand have been collected by Roger Hui at [http://www.jsoftware.com/papers/](http://www.jsoftware.com/papers/).

### [Notebook: Justifying Text](https://github.com/Dyalog/dyalog-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/Justifying%20Text.ipynb)
This notebook takes a look at how to write some _array-oriented_ APL code that justifies some text. In case you are wondering what "justified text" is, take a look at the [example in the Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_alignment#Examples).

(The content of this notebook draws heavily from [Lesson 42](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/52405/conversation/lesson-42-array-coding-style-in-depth) of the [APL Cultivation chat lessons](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/info/52405/the-apl-orchard?tab=conversations) and is a written follow-up to Rodrigo Girão Serrão's presentation at [APL Seeds'21](https://www.dyalog.com/apl-seeds-user-meetings/aplseeds21.htm).)

### [Notebook: Boolean Scans and Reductions](https://github.com/Dyalog/dyalog-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/Boolean%20Scans%20and%20Reductions.ipynb)
These techniques for manipulation of Boolean arrays are general purpose and useful when writing high performance code.
