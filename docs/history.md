## APL Campfire
The **APL Campfire** was a recurring meeting hosted by [Adám Brudzewsky](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Ad%C3%A1m_Brudzewsky "Adám Brudzewsky") every fourth Sunday at 18:00 UTC, from 9 May 2021 until 12 June 2022, switching to an irregular schedule after that. Each session is about an hour. The event focuses on the history of APL programming, inviting participants to tell stories of their experiences in an informal setting. The meetings are recorded for future reference.

The [APL Wiki article about APL Campfire](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/APL_Campfire) has a list of all sessions with links to video recordings.
