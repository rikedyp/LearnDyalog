## APL Language
APL language is a very ergonomic language for problem solving. Once you have learned the basic syntax and some of the functionality, it is likely you will be able to tackle a wide range of problems and come to a working solution. That may not be the *optimal* solution, in terms of readability, maintainability or computational efficiency - but it is hopefully a *correct* solution.
