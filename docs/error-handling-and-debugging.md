# Error Handling and Debugging
Applications can contain errors due to programming mistakes, incorrect use of function calls, or external reasons, such as a missing file or the abnormal termination of an external (non-APL) piece of code.

You can learn about errors and by understanding them in the context of your application you can use error trapping and signalling to provide more useful messages to your application's users.

For debugging, the tracer allows the setting of break points, watch points, and full edit-and-resume capabilities. You can edit your code in place to resolve issues (fix errors) and resume execution.

Testing is an important part of robust application development. By writing and running test suites you can have more confidence that your application will behave as expected.
